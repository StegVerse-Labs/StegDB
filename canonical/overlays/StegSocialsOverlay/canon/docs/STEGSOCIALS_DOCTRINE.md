# StegSocials Doctrine

## Goal
Create social trust by helping people align:
- what they are experiencing
- with what they are reading
- through transparent sourcing + confidence

## Outputs (the only promises we make)
1) **Claim Packet** (structured, auditable, source-linked)
2) **Post Pack** (platform-ready narrative + bullets + citations)
3) **Sources Log** (exact links + retrieval notes)
4) **Confidence Notes** (what is confirmed vs inferred)

## Non-goals (v1)
- We do not “declare truth.” We disclose evidence.
- We do not scrape private data.
- We do not publish personal identifiers.

## Trust signals
- Every claim has: scope, time window, sources, confidence, counterpoints
- Every post references the packet ID
- All templates remain auditable in git
