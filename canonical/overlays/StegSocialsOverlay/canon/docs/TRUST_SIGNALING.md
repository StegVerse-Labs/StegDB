# Trust Signaling

## What wins trust (practically)
- concise summaries
- clear sourcing
- admitting uncertainty
- showing counterpoints (steelman, not strawman)
- consistent formatting so people learn what to expect

## What loses trust
- sensational framing without sources
- hiding assumptions
- mixing verified facts with speculation without labeling

## Required labels (v1)
- CONFIRMED (direct source)
- CORROBORATED (multiple independent sources)
- PLAUSIBLE (credible but incomplete)
- DISPUTED (credible disagreement exists)
- UNKNOWN (insufficient evidence)
