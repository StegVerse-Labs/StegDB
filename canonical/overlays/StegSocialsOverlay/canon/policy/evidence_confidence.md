# Evidence Confidence Policy (v1)

Confidence is a communication tool, not a verdict.

## Levels
- A: Direct primary source (official docs, recordings, first-hand data)
- B: Multiple reputable secondaries corroborate
- C: Single reputable secondary or partial primary
- D: Unverified / viral / anonymous
- E: Disproven / manipulated / fabricated

## Rule
Any post must include:
- confidence level
- a short “why”
- at least one link (unless safety requires omitting)
