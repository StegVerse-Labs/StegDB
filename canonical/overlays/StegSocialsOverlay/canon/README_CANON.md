# StegSocials — Canon Overlay

This folder is synced from StegDB and defines the *doctrine + templates + policies* for StegSocials.

## What canon/ owns
- doctrine (docs/)
- trust + evidence policies (policy/)
- repeatable templates (templates/)

## What canon/ does NOT own
Everything outside `canon/` is repo-local implementation and may evolve freely.

## Primary purpose
Turn real-world experience + verifiable sources into:
- consistent “claim packets”
- platform-ready post packs
- transparent sourcing and confidence scoring
- durable audit trail without doxxing users
