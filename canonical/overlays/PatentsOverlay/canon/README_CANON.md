# Patents Canon Overlay (StegDB)

This folder is synced from `stegverse-labs/stegdb` as an **overlay**.

## What this overlay controls
- Canonical doctrine and safety rules for patent work
- Canonical templates (optional references)
- Canonical allowlist format & manifest expectations

## What this overlay never touches
- `entities/` (runtime AI entity scripts)
- existing `templates/` in this repo
- disclosures/provisionals outputs
- local workflows except the overlay sync workflow itself

## Release discipline
This overlay is intended to be pulled by tag/SHA at release intervals.
