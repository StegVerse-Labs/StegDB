# KnowledgeVault — Canon Overlay

This folder is synced from StegDB and defines the *doctrine + contract templates + safety policies* for KnowledgeVault.

## What canon/ owns
- doctrine (docs/)
- contract templates (templates/)
- safety/redaction policy (policy/)

## What canon/ does NOT own
Everything outside `canon/` is repo-local implementation and may evolve freely.

## Primary purpose
Make KnowledgeVault immediately useful by giving users:
- clear ownership rules
- compensable sharing primitives
- expiry / inertness enforcement expectations
- auditable retrieval receipts
