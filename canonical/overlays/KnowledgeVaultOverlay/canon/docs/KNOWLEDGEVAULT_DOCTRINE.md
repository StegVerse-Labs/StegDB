# KnowledgeVault Doctrine

## Goal
A user-owned vault that remains usable for decades:
- portable formats
- transparent indexing
- predictable retrieval
- auditable access

## Required properties (v1)
- Human-readable first (Markdown/JSON)
- Content-addressable mindset (hashes where practical)
- Clear provenance (“where did this come from?”)
- Minimal dependence on any platform

## Sharing stance
Sharing is opt-in and contractual:
- user chooses: public / licensed / private
- every use can be compensated
- every share has expiry / inertness requirements
